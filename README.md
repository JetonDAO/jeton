# Jeton: A Decentralized and Trustless Poker Platform

Jeton is a decentralized poker platform designed to ensure fairness and transparency in online poker games. Built on the Aptos blockchain, Jeton eliminates the need for players to trust a central authority by leveraging zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) and Elgamal encryption. These cryptographic techniques guarantee that the cards are shuffled, encrypted, and dealt fairly without revealing any information to players or the platform itself.

The platform utilizes Elgamal encryption on the JubJub elliptic curve to securely encrypt cards and zk-SNARK circuits to verify both the shuffle and decryption processes. Each player participates in shuffling the deck and generating decryption shares, ensuring no individual player or entity can manipulate the outcome. Smart contracts on the Aptos blockchain handle the game logic and verify cryptographic proofs, providing a fully decentralized and tamper-proof environment for online poker.

For a more detailed explanation of the algorithms, security considerations, and cryptographic methods used in Jeton, you can read the [full project overview](project-overview.md).

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `web`: the web application of the jeton protocol, implemented in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- `@jeton/zk-deck`: a package containing Move, TypeScript, and Circom code, for implementing zero knowledge based playing decks
- `@jeton/smart-contracts`: a Move package responsible for on chain game logic
- `@jeton/ts-sdk`:
- `@jeton/ui`: a React component library shared by `web` application
- `@jeton/tailwindcss-config`: 
- `@jeton/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo
  Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This repo has some additional tools setuped:

- [TurboRepo](https://turbo.build/) for running monorepo tasks
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for code linting and formatting

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the correct versions of Node.js and npm installed:

- **Node.js**: v20.16 or later
- **npm**: v10.8 or later

You can use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install the required version
of node and npm.

Also you need rustc and cargo install. It is recommended to use
[rustup](https://rustup.rs/) to install them.

After that you need to also install circom using:

```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/iden3/circom.git --tag v2.1.9
```

### Cloning the Repository

To get started, first clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/JetonDAO/jeton.git
cd jeton
```

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```shell
cd jeton
npm run build
```

### Adding NPM Packages

ðŸš« Avoid Adding packages directly inside your package

To add a npm package `pkg` use the following command:

```shell
cd jeton
npm install --workspace=<YOUR PROJECT/WORKSPACE> [--save|--save-dev] pkg
```

For example:

```shell
cd jeton
npm install --workspace=apps/web --save-dev @cloudflare/next-on-pages
```

### Lint Project

To lint all apps and packages, run the following command:

```shell
cd jeton
npm run check
```

To run the linter and automatically fix problems run:

```shell
cd jeton
npm run fix
```

### Develop All

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```shell
cd jeton
npm run dev
```

### Develop Web

To develop only the web app, run the following command:

```shell
cd jeton
npm run dev-web
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```shell
cd jeton
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```shell
npx turbo link
```
